My name is Tanay Komarlu and I am a 3rd year CS student. With this project, I hope to be able to create a Discord bot that allows users to automate moderation of discord servers. The bot could eventually make use of the twitter apis to post the most recent tweets by a twitter user as well. Some other features could include games based on text input and playing music in discord voice chats given a youtube link.
