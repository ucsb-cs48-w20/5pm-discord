Problem Scenario #1:

    (George/Male/late teens/English) 
    
George is a discord moderator that moderates a discord server with 50 members. The users cause the server to descend into anarchy and he is unable to control them. He finds it cumbersome to delete profane messages and permanently ban his friends from the server. 

Problem Scenario #2:

    (Chad/Male/early twenties/American)
    
Chad is a high schooler that runs a small Discord server for his friends. His friends find his discord server boring and threaten to leave. They frequently spend their time outside instead of online.
