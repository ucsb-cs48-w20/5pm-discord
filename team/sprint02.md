Max: Did not do anything. Working on creating a token for the bot so we can work on the bots together.

Agenda Item:
How to make a token for Discord Bot:
Go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/
Create New application. Name it whatever you want. Pick an avatar if you want. Click on the bot tab and add a bot. And click reveal token to get your token. Copy paste this into token.json. The bot should be able to login and run the code on github now. Remember to choose a unique avatar for your bot.
